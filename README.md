Official implementation of **TabDLM**, a framework for synthetic tabular data generation that couples a diffusion language model with continuous numerical diffusion. TabDLM learns joint denoising over numerical, categorical, and free-form text features, and supports standard tabular as well as tabular-with-text generation.

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10, a CUDA-capable GPU (recommended ≥ 40 GB; reduce batch size if needed).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilikevegetable/TabDLM.git
cd TabDLM
```

Create a conda environment and install dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n tabdlm python=3.10 -y
conda activate tabdlm

# Install PyTorch for your CUDA build first (see https://pytorch.org)
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

Prepared splits are already included under `data/tabular/<dataset_name>/` (`train.csv`, `valid.csv`, `test.csv`, `info.json`, `*.jsonl`). **You do not need to rerun data preparation** for the benchmark datasets in this repo.

Ground-truth tables for evaluation live under `data/synthetic/<dataset_name>/`. Scripts such as `data/prepare_tabular_data.py` and `data/tabular_wtext_generation_*.py` are kept only for reference or custom datasets.

---

## Quick Start

All commands assume the repository root:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.
```

Train and sample (with evaluation) for a dataset using the provided shell scripts:

```bash
bash scripts/run_shoppers.sh
bash scripts/run_biography.sh
bash scripts/run_rel_arxiv.sh
# ... see scripts/run_*.sh
```

Each script runs `python main.py train` then `python main.py sample` with the hyperparameters used in our experiments. Checkpoints and `train_args.json` are written to `ckpt/<dataset_name>/<description>_{best,last}/`. Synthetic CSVs are saved under `result/<dataset_name>/synthetic_result/`.
